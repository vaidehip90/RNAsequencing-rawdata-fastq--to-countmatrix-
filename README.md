# RNAsequencing-rawdata-fastq--to-countmatrix

RNAsequencing is a technique that uses Next generation sequencing for presence of RNA quanity. RNAseq provides the insight of transcriptome of the cell. There are many advantages of RNAseq as facilities the discovery of novel transcript, identification of spliced genes.RNAseq investigates different population of the RNA including the total RNA,pre-RNA, noncoding RNA,microRNA.

RNAseq produces the raw fastq file with reads that needs to be processed by Quality control, mapping to reference genome and then coverting to BAM to count matrix for downstream analysis such as Differential expression.

In this project, I used two dataset including SRR5924196 and SRR5924198. This dataset can be downloaded from SRA. The Yeast reference genome are downloaded from ESEMbL such as fasta and gtf files.
